         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Faith properly is to beleue, and to beleue is to aſſente to trewth. This faith the age of S. Auguſtine, S.

                     <p>BVt as the benefite of Iuſtification is al one, ſo it is not receiued of al after one manner. For ſuch as are borne in ſinne, and by mercie called to the ſtate of iuſtice, eyther they be called and chriſtened in theyre infancie, as it is nowe vſed throughowt the Chriſtian worlde: or elles they be called to it in theyre perfecte age, as it was
<pb facs="tcp:177584:17"/> vſed when the Goſpel was preached to them that were borne and brought vp in infidelitie.</p>
                     <p>The eſtate of infantes aſketh moſte fauour and mercie: for as S. Cyprian ſaieth:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3</hi> epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; Augu. ſer. <hi>14.</hi> de ver. Apoſt.</note>

                     <p>This is the graciouſe and moſt free Iuſtification of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes, which they atteyne vnto, not onely without any good doing of their owne, but alſo without any conſent.

                     </p>
                     <p>And to minſe this matter more finely, ſome haue yet gone further: And whereas the Catholike Churche folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the manifeſt Srciptures, hath euer taught, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is iuſtified through the merite of Chriſt and his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, by faith, hope, charitie and penance: they haue taught that he is iuſtified by faith only, and although they graunt, that he muſt haue both hope and charitie, that ſhal be iuſtified, yet is it faith onely, ſaie they, that ſtriketh the ſtroke in the acte of Iuſtification, hope and charitie ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by as lookers on, but working nothing.</p>

                     <head>That Faith excludeth not Charitie in our Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſaie, Faith alone iuſtifieth no man, without the helpe and woorking of Charitie. <hi>THE III. CHAPTER.</hi>

It hath ben declared before,<note place="margin">In the. 4. Chapter.</note> that our Iuſtification in Chriſte, is but the reſtoring of that whiche was loſt by Adam. And as Adam ſinned, not onely by lacke of faith, but rather and much more, by lacke of good wil and right loue, ſo is not a man once fallen, reſtored againe by reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering onely righte faith, vnleſſe he recouer alſo righte loue. The ſinne of Adam was chiefely a peruerſe deſire and luſte, through a loue ſettled where it ſhould not be, pulled from God and delyte heauenly, and ſettled on him ſelfe and thinges tranſitorie. And as that peruerſe loue, which is called <hi>luſte,</hi> made him of good and righteouſe,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Praefat. Pſal. <hi>31.</hi> Auguſt. in Titul. Pſal. <hi>64.</hi>

If then it plainely appeare, that all theſe fiue pointes be wroughte in vs, eſpecially by charitie, wee muſt needes confeſſe, that charitie doth not onely worke, but ſingularly worke in the acte of our Iuſtification.</p>
                     <p>To proue the firſte and ſeconde pointe, S. Iohn ſaith: <hi>Euerie man that loueth,</hi>

                        <hi>is borne of God, and knoweth God. He that loueth not, knoweth not God, for God is charitie.</hi> The thirde pointe he proueth by theſe wordes:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Nos ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> We knowe, <hi>that we are tranſlated from death to lyfe, bicauſe we loue our brethren: he that loueth not, remaineth in death.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt. in expo. epiſt. ad Galat.</note> Of the fourth point, S. Auguſtine ſaith: <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Chriſtus in eo qui formam accepit Chriſti.</hi> Chriſt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in him, that hath receiued the fourme and ſhape of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177584:41"/> Chriſt, but he it is that receiueth the ſhape of Chriſt, who cleaueth faſte to Chriſte by a goſtely and ſpirituall loue. The fifte pointe is proued by S. Paule, who taketh it for al one <hi>to be made a newe creature</hi> and to haue <hi>faith that worketh throughe charitie.</hi> For as he ſaieth:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>In Christe Ieſu neither circumciſion,</hi>

                        <hi>nor to be without circumciſion auaileth ought, but faith that worketh through charitie.</hi> So he ſaith: <hi>Neither circumciſion nor to be without circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion auaileth ought, but the newe creature.</hi> This being proued, that man knoweth God, is borne of God, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life, newe fourmed in Chriſte, and finally made a newe creature by Charitie, it is alſo proued conſequentely, that man is iuſtified eſpecially through Charitie.</p>
                     <p>I go not abowte here to abaſe the excellente gifte of faith nor to ſaie, charitie onely iuſtifieth, excluding faith, which is the foundation of all rightuouſenes. my intente is onely to ſhewe, howe ſhamefull a diuorce they make, that parte theſe ſo wel agreeing vertues in the acte of our Iuſtification, whiche God hath ioined together.<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>19</hi> Leo ſerm. <hi>7.</hi> de qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drag.</note> For trewely it is ſaied. <hi>Charitas robur eſt fidei, fides fortitudo eſt charitatis.</hi> Charitie is the force of faith, faith is the ſtrength of Charitie, <hi>and then is the name trewe, and trew fruite of bothe, when eche remayneth ſure and faſte knitte to other.</hi> Seing then that Iuſtification is the greateſt fruite that can come of faith, it foloweth, that the ſame can not be had without thaid of charity. Faith may be in a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charitie, but it maketh no man rightuouſe and iuſte, but by charitie. S. Auguſtine ſaith, A man may beleue that Chriſt is Chriſt, by faith without hope and charitie: but he can not beleue in Chriſte, whiche is as muche to ſaie,
<pb facs="tcp:177584:42"/> as to be vnited and made a member of Chriſte, without hope and charitie.<note place="margin">Aug. Ser. <hi>61.</hi> De ver. De.</note>

                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In which place three thinges are to be noted: firſt he ſaith, that faith alone is ſufficiente for vs to beleue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſte is Chriſte. Next, he ſaith, that faith alone is not inough to make a man the member of Chriſt. Thirdely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he ſaith, that faith, hope and charity ioined together make a man the member of Chriſt. Wherefore ſeing that to be iuſtified is nothing els but to be made a member of Chriſt: it is a plaine matter with S. Auguſtine, that faith only can not iuſtifie, bicauſe it can not make a man the member of Chriſte. And for as muche as that effecte is wroughte by the three vertues ioined together, it foloweth alſo that hope, and charitie worke in the acte of our Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as Faith.</p>
                     <p>Faith can not onely iuſtifie no man without charitie, but as S. Bernarde ſaieth, dieth, if charitie be pulled from it.<note place="margin">Bernar. Ser. <hi>24.</hi> ſuper Canti.</note> 
                        <hi>Mors fidei eſt ſeparatio charitatis.</hi> It is the death of Faith to be parted from charitie. <hi>And he that diuideth them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is fideicida,</hi> a murtherer of Faith.</p>

                        </note> Bicauſe ſhe hath not loue whiche is her very ſowle. If faith when ſhe is without charitie, wanteth her ſowle and life, without the which ſhe can doo no acte, howe ſhould ſhe without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177584:42"/> charitie worke that greate acte of our Iuſtification?</p>
                     <p>To make the matter plaine, we ſhall neede but one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument grounded vppon the wordes of S. Paule.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gala.</hi> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>In Chriſt Ieſu neither circumciſion, nor to be without circumciſion auaileth any thing, but faith that worketh through charitie.</hi> If that be the Faithe that auaileth, whiche worketh through charitie, then faithe alone deſtitute of charitie auaileth nothing. If it auaile nothing, muche leſſe dothe it worke our Iuſtification: For that is not onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but it is as S. Auguſtine and Proſper Aquitanus ſay,<note place="margin">Aug. tra. in Ioan. <hi>72.</hi> Proſper de promiſ. part. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi> l'e fide &amp; oper. cap. <hi>14.</hi> De gratia &amp; lib. arbit. cap. <hi>7.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>107.</hi> Enchi. c. <hi>8.</hi> Aug. de fide &amp; oper. ca. <hi>14</hi>

                        <hi>a greater worke, then to make heauen and earth, or to bring a deade man to life againe.</hi> The argument is not mine, but ſuche as S. Auguſtine vſeth, and repeteth almoſt as often as he ſpeaketh of Iuſtification: Saying that S. Paule by theſe wordes hath decided and determined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Non quamlibet fidem qua in Deum creditur. &amp;c.</hi> It is not euery Faith whereby a man beleueth in God, <hi>that the Apoſtle determineth to be healthfull and Euangelicall, but that is the Faith, ſaith he, which worketh through charitie: wherevppon he auoucheth that the Faith, which ſome take to be ſufficiente for their ſaluation, auaileth nothing: in ſo muche that he ſaith: If I haue all Faith, in ſuche ſorte that I be able to moue hilles owt of theire places, and haue no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, I am nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I woulde ſeeke a plainer deciſion, if any thing coulde be more plainely ſpoken. He ſaith, S. Paule hath defined, that there is but one Faithe auailable, to witte, the faithe that worketh through charitie. He ſaith,<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>15.</hi> de ver. apoſt. De fide &amp; oper. c <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note> all other Faithe what ſo euer it be, auaileth nothing. He ſaith, and that verie often, that <hi>Faith deſtitute of charitie maie be not onely in euill men, but alſo in the diuell him ſelfe.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:177584:43"/> calleth it <hi>fidem damoniorum,</hi> the faith of diuelles.</p>
                     <p>And leſte any man ſhould ſaie, that albeit good workes are done by charitie, yet is all to be imputed to faithe, whiche is the cauſe that worketh al,<note place="margin">Note vvel</note> S. Paule ſaith on the other ſide, that faith it ſelfe taketh her doing and working of charitie. For as they know that vnderſtand the Greke tongue, ἐνεργουμένη is a participle of paſsiue ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and rightely ſhoulde he tranſlate the wordes of S. Paule, who ſhoulde ſaie, <hi>That faith in Chriſt Ieſu is auailable, whiche is made actiue and doing thorough charitie.</hi> For if we will ſpeake of the nature of faithe as it is by it ſelfe, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,<note place="margin">In the 2.

                     <p>And bicauſe all knowledge be it of the Scriptures, or the articles of our Crede, maie be, not onely in il men, but in diuels alſo: Faith is not able of her ſelfe to make a man iuſte and righteouſe, vnleſſe ſhee take vnto her hope, and charitie, and ſo be made actiue and doing: by the one to hope in God, by the other to loue God and man. whiche concluſion concerning charitie S.

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Ergo ſi nihil mihi prodeſt fides ſine charitate. &amp;c.</hi> If faithe then auaile me nothing without charitie, <hi>and charitie whereſoeuer it be, muſte needes be working, faithe it ſelfe by charitie hath her working.</hi>

                     <p>Reaſon in man is the thing that maketh the difference betwene him and al brute beaſtes: which be called brute, bicauſe they lacke reaſon. For which cauſe, Reaſon, as the principal power of the ſowle is called of the Philoſopher εντελέχεια, the forme and perfection that maketh a man.</p>
                     <p>In like manner charitie is the thing that maketh the difference betwene faith and faith, betwene the faith of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177584:43"/> a good and an ill man, betwene the faith of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and vncleane diuelles. As S.

For the Apoſtle S.

                        <hi>The Diuelles ſaid, Chriſt was the ſonne of God, through feare. S. Peter ſaid it through loue: Put hope then to faith. And what hope is there, without ſome good conſcience? put vnto hope it ſelfe, charitie.</hi> And ſomewhat after that: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make a difference of your faith, then are ye of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinates of the called, and of the iuſtified.</hi> And in the ſame Sermon to conclude, he ſaith:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gala.</hi> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Therefore if there be in you faith that worketh through loue, now belonge you to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinates, to the called, and to the iuſtified. Let that faith therefore growe in you that is working by charitie: for faith working by charitie can not be without hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if charitie be it, that maketh the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene faith, and faith, as S. Auguſtine proueth, and if that which maketh the difference betwene any one creature and al other, be the perfection, life, and ſowle, of that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Then is charitie not an inſtrument to ſerue faith, but the life and ſowle of faith, without the helpe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof, faith neither iuſtifieth, neither worketh

                     <pb facs="tcp:177584:45"/>

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> So doth he ſaie: <hi>Abraham was not iuſtified by his workes,</hi> he deſerued not Gods grace and his Iuſtification by his owne doinges: he was not able to crake againſt God, nor to preſume of him ſelfe.

Otherwiſe, if it had ben his intent to exclude the giftes of God, vertues and workes of faith, we might ſaie with S. Auguſtine:<note place="margin">Auguſt. in praefatio. Pſalm. <hi>31.</hi>

                     <p>THVS haue I nowe by Gods helpe, finiſhed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond parte of this Treatie, wherein mine intente hath ben to aduertiſe the Chriſtian Reader,<note place="margin">See the Preface.</note> how to eſchewe the ſecond great, or rather moſt dangerouſe fal, on the lefte hande, whiche S.

                        </note> 
                        <hi>The perill is for men to preſume only of Goddes mercie, dooing nothing them ſelues, towarde their owne ſaluation: whiche opinion,</hi> he ſaieth, <hi>if any man folowe, leadeth him vndoubtedly to euerlasting ruine of ſowle and bodie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And bicauſe the onely or readieſt meane to leade a man to that fall, is, to thinke that faith alone may ſuffiſe to iuſtifie and ſaue vs: I haue at good length prooued, that faith alone is not inough to bring a ſinner from ſinnefull eſtate to Gods fauour, nor of wicked to make him righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſe, without the woorking and helpe of hope, charitie, penance, and the Sacramentes of Chriſt: wherein I haue ben the longer, bicauſe this opinion is lately crepte into the worlde, and nowe ſpred farre and wide. For albeit in times paſt, ſome thought they might be ſaued without good woorkes, yet did they not ſaie, they might be ſaued without the Sacramentes:<note place="margin">De fide &amp; oper. c. <hi>27</hi>
                        </note> As by this booke of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine thou maieſt ſee. And ſo all be it they waded deepe inough to drowne them ſelues, yet wente they not ſo farre into the bottomeleſſe goulfe, as ſundrie haue done in this our age, who ſaie, that nothing woorketh in the acte of our Iuſtification, but onely faith. And therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon haue brought in, this propoſition, and made it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:177584:88"/> ſpeache emong them ſelues and theirs, <hi>Faith alone iuſtifieth,</hi> excluding therby from the acte of our Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not onely hope, charitie, and penance, but alſo the very Sacramentes. For if faith alone iuſtifie a ſinner, and make him of wicked rightuouſe, then is there none of theſe requiſite or neceſſary for that effecte, whiche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer anie aunciente man learned, that I haue ſeene, didde maineteine.</p>
                     <p>I haue further declared, that faith alone can continue no man in the ſtate of grace, muche leſſe increaſe him in iuſtice, and leaſt of all, bring him to the ende and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſtice in life euerlaſting without the helpe of good woorkes. And ſo is the opinion of Iuſtification by onely faith in trueth and deede diſprooued, and founde vntrue, in no ſenſe maintenable, as they take it: I ſaie as they take it. For although certaine aunciente Fathers ſometime vſed theſe woordes, <hi>Faith alone iuſtifieth:</hi> yet doe they not meane thereby, as theſe doe, to exclude any of the vertues afore named, or Sacramentes, as I haue plainely ſhewed.<note place="margin">In the .18.

For this is that <hi>crowne of Iuſtice</hi> whiche the Apoſtle ſaied,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>was laied vp for him after his conflicte and running, whiche</hi> he ſaied, <hi>ſhould be rendered vnto him by the iuſte iudge:</hi> And not onely to him, but alſo <hi>to all them, that loue the comming of Chriſte.</hi> For ſeing that the ſelfe ſame Chriſte Ieſus doth continually ſende downe by influence into them, that are iuſtified, as the head into the members, and as a vine into his branches, a vertue, the whiche vertue goeth before, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, and foloweth their good woorkes, without the whiche their woorkes could not poſsibly be acceptable to God and meritorious: we ought to beleeue, that there lacketh nothing els in ſuch as are iuſtified, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they maie not be thought, by their good woorkes, whiche are done in God, to haue ſatisfied the lawe of God, (ſo muche, as the ſtate of this life requireth) and truly to haue deſerued life euerlaſting, which they ſhal enioy, when the time cometh, if ſo be that, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life in grace: for ſo much as Chriſte our Sauiour ſaieth:<note place="margin">

Let theſe hardely be thy Arbitrers in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe preſent controuerſies. They lacked no learning to know the Truthe. They wanted no vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to write as they knewe. They can not be partiall: They knewe neither parties. They liued, taught and flouriſhed in the time of Truth by the Aduerſaries owne Confeſsion. To ſpeake farder in the commendation of theſe moſt holy and learned Fathers, it were but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. There nedeth no candle, when the day light ſhineth. Where good wine is, there nedeth no garland to hange out. Theſe Fathers commends them ſelues. All the Chriſtian worlde reuerenceth them, and crediteth them, as holy Fathers, as moſt learned Doctours, as ſingular lightes of the Churche of Chriſte, bothe Greke and Latin. To whom this publike teſtimony of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſuffiſeth not, to him nothing will ſuffiſe.</p>
                  <p>Reade therefore, Chriſtian Reader. Vſe, and peruſe. And reading theſe, remember that thou readeſt not any writer of late yeares, any priuate learned man, any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Iudgement or doctrine. But that thou readeſt in theſe the doctrine of the primitiue Churche, Auncient and generally approued Fathers, briefely the publike Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and common voice of all Chriſtendom. And that not certaine of their ſayinges, culled out from the whole, but their whole and full Treaties, word for word
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177584:108"/> as they wrote them, laied before thee. Laſt of all, not any ſuche writinges, as they wrote by waie of controuerſy as againſt an Aduerſary, but partly a ſettled and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine, ſuch as S. Auguſtines Treatie is, partly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies and ſermons made and pronounced to the whole people (ſuche as all the reſt are) in whiche kinde of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Paſtour of Goddes people, will be moſt aduiſed what he ſpeaketh, and muche more what he writeth. To make an ende: Thou haſt hitherto hearde learned men prouing and debating matters now in controuerſy, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Fathers ſayinges, gathered together, with their owne deuiſe and induſtry. Nowe thou heareſt the Fathers them ſelues to tell their owne tales. Thou ſeeſt the maner of their writing, Thou learneſt by their owne talke, what their faith was. Onely I haue made them to ſpeake in Engliſh, as faithefully, as truly, and as familiarly, as I coulde poſsibly doo, not ſwaruing one iote from their wordes and meaning. Accepte my poore labour in good parte, which I haue taken to edifie many, to offend none. And our Lorde of his mercy geue bothe to thee (gentle Reader) and to me, of his holy Grace, that we may folow and practiſe in woorkes, that which theſe holy Fathers do teache vs in woordes. That as ſinne hath bene the cauſe of this horrible ſchiſme and manifolde hereſies that nowe raigne, ſo amendement of life maie be a meane to ſtay the raging courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to call vs home to vnite againe, to the honour of God, and peace of his Church.

But nowe whereas it is well knowen, that the Apoſtles wrote their Epiſtles onely to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans already baptiſed, why yet doe their Epiſtles then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine bothe theſe preceptes? I meane, preceptes tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith, and preceptes towching good lyfe? But wherefore ſhoulde they not ſo doe? Thinke theſe men (trowe wee) that to ſuche as come to be baptiſed, we ought not to geaue bothe, and to ſuche as are baptiſed we muſt geaue bothe? Whiche if they thinke abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, then lette them confeſſe, that the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles gaue their doctrine perfecte, of bothe thoſe pointes: but therefore to haue moſt commonly begunne with Faith, and then to haue folowed with that whiche apperteineth to good lyfe, bicauſe that in man him ſelfe, onleſſe faith goe before, good lyfe can not followe.</p>

                     <p>Nowe if ſome fooliſhe and vnſkilful perſonnes would thinke the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles to haue benne written to Cathecumenes, and ſuche as are not yet baptiſed: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then muſt they withall confeſſe, that preceptes of good manners agreable with faith, are togeather with the rules of faith to be opened and taught vnto ſuche are as not yet baptiſed. Onleſſe perhappes by this their diſputation and reaſoning, they will haue vs to ſaie, that the former partes of the Apoſtles Epiſtles, wherein they ſpake of faith, were to be readde of the Cathecumenes, and the latter partes, wherein preceptes are geauen howe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhoulde liue, to be readde of the faithfull.

                     <p>Theyr Doctrine therefore hathe no proufe out of the Apoſtles Epiſtles, nor argument to perſwade vs to thinke that thoſe which are to be baptiſed ſhoulde be inſtructed in faith onely, and thoſe that be baptiſed, inſtructed in good life, by reaſon that in the former partes of their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they commended faith, and after conſequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the faithfull to liue well. For although, that be in the firſt place, and this in the later place, yet are bothe, by one vndiuided maner of ſpeache, moſt often to be taught: bothe to the Cathecumenes: both to the faithfull: bothe to them that are to be baptiſed, and bothe to them that are alreadie baptiſed. To the one, that they may learne: to the other, that they forgette not what they haue learned. To the one, that they may profeſſe: to the other, that they may continewe in moſte holſeſome and ſounde doctrine. To the Epiſtles then of Peter, and of Iohn, out of the whiche they bring certaine teſtimonies, lette them adde both the Epiſtles of S. Paule, and of al the other Apoſtles, and vnderſtande them all, ſo to be written, as that they would haue firſt faith, and then manners to be ioyntly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee muſt take heede, that wee thinke not theſe para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſimilitudes propounded to that ende (whether it be that of the vncleane beaſtes within the Arke, or what ſo euer ſuche lyke which ſignifie the ſame) that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline ſhould therefore ſleepe (whereof it was ſaied in the figure of that wooman,<note place="margin">

For neither by theſe ſimilitudes, parables, and foreſhewinges, is there geeuen to the good, any counſel of ſlouth or ſlacknes, wherby they ſhould neglect that, which they ought to forbid: but of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, wherby (preſeruing alwaie the doctrine of truth) they may ſuffer and beare that, whiche they can not amende. Nor yet bicauſe it is written, that there entred alſo vncleane beaſtes into the Arke to Noe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 7.</note> therfore the Prelates ſhoulde not forbid, and ſtay, if any moſt lewde and vncleane perſons will preſume to enter to Baptiſme, as light dawncers, which were verely leſſe yll, then filthy adulterers: But by this figure of a thing done, it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed, that vncleane perſons ſhould be in the church, by meane of toleration, not by corruption of doctrine, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute breaking of diſcipline and good order. For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſtes came not in, where, and of whiche ſide them liſted, the faſt frame of the Arke being in any part
<pb facs="tcp:177584:145"/> broken, or ſundered: but the ſame being whole and ſound they entred all at one onely doore, which the woorkman had made.</p>
                     <p>An other queſtion is vppon that it ſeemed good vnto them, that only faith ſhoulde be preached to them that were to be Baptiſed, and that after Baptiſme, they ſhould be taught, of woorkes and manners. But if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it hath beene ſufficiently ſhewed, that it dooth then chiefly appertaine to the care and dewty of the ouerſeer, when all they whiche deſire together the Sacrament of the faithfull, doo moſt intentiuely and carefully harken, to all that is ſaied then, expreſſely and plainely to open the paine, which our Lord threateneth to them that liue yll: leaſt they become gilty of moſt greuous crimes, euen in the Baptiſme it ſelfe, whervnto they come to haue the gilt of all their former ſinnes remitted.</p>
                     <p>The third queſtion is the moſt daungerous of al. Of the whiche (being ſlenderly conſidered, and not handled according to the woorde of God) is ryſen (as to me ſeemeth) all that other foule opinion, wherin there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſuche as lyue moſt lewdely, and ſhamefully, yea though they continue in ſuche liuing, if they onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſte, and receaue his Sacramentes, that they ſhall come to eternall life and ſaluation. Whiche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is againſt the moſt manifeſt ſaying of our Lorde, who to him that deſired eternall life,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.</note> aunſwered: <hi>If thou wilt come vnto life, keepe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes:</hi> and ſhewed farder, what commaundementes: ſuch truly, wherin thoſe ſinnes are forbidden, wherevnto eternall life is nowe (I know not howe) promiſed thorough faith:<note place="margin">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177584:145"/> (as I thinke) ſufficiently diſputed, and haue ſhewed that the euill are ſo to be tolerated in the Churche, that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Diſcipline be not neglected. That they whiche deſire Baptiſme are ſo to be inſtructed, that they may not onely heare, and take vppon them what they ſhould beleeue, but alſo howe they ſhoulde lyue.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177584:146"/> and eſteeming, that, to offer our prayers with a pure and ſincere harte vnto God, is the only life, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health, the only riches, and the onely ſcope, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all that good is.

And that ſo it is, yea and a muche hygher preeminence, they them ſelues doo teache vs, offering truely theyr prayers,<note place="margin">Hovv and after vvhat manner vve ſhold praye.</note> with muche tremblinge: and geeuing thereby example vnto vs, to knowe and learne, that who ſo euer preſenteth him ſelfe before God, muſt doo it with muche ioye, and yet with great trembling. With trembling, while wee
<pb facs="tcp:177584:147"/> feare leaſte wee may ſeeme vnwoorthy by our prayers to haue ſpeache vnto God. With Ioye, when we thinke of the greatneſſe of the honour, whiche God of his ſo greate care ouer vs, hath voucheſafed to beſtowe on creatures of mortall kinde, that it may be lawfull for vs, continually to haue the Ioye and fruition, of ſpeaking with his Diuine Maieſtie.</p>

For though by nature we be mortal, yet by this ſpeache and familiar life whiche we leade with God, we paſſe ouer to an immortall life. For of neceſsitie it followeth, that he whiche hath familiaritie with God, getteth to be ouer death, and ouer all ſuche thinges as are ſubiect to corruption. And as it can not be, that he which enioyeth the light of the ſonne beames, ſhould be in darkeneſſe: ſo neither can it be by any meanes, that he which vſeth to company with God, ſhould ſtill remayne mortal. For the very heigth and excellency of this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, doth transfer vs to immortallity. For if they that haue free ſpeach with th'emperour, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant familiarly with him, can not lightly be poore after that honour got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at his hand: much leſſe may it be, that they which by prayer, dayly, and familiarly ſpeake with God, ſhould haue ſoules ſubiect to death.<note place="margin">VVhat the death of the ſoule is.</note> For the death of the ſoule is impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a lyfe which is lead contrary to the lawe of God.

                  <p>For euen this is a moſte euidente argumente of a franticke and fonde minde, not to vnderſtande the great excellencie of this honour: not to loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in prayer: and not to knowe, that then the ſowle is dead, when it is not with all looue and humilitie, laied proſtrate before the feete of God. For euen as this our bodie, if the ſowle and lyfe be awaie, is truely dead and ſtinking: euen ſo the ſowle except ſhe raiſe and ſtirre her ſelfe vppe to prayer, is dead, wretched, and of very euill and vnpleaſant ſauour. And to the ende we may truely conceiue this, and thinke it in dede a more heauy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful thing then any death, to be depraued of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte of prayer,<note place="margin">A notable example.</note> that Prophet Daniel dothe wel teache vs. Who did choſe rather to ſuffer death, then onely by the ſpace of three daies to be kept from praying: for the King of Perſians Darius,<note place="margin">

But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet indured not to forbeare prayer ſo muche as for that little ſpace. For why? He knewe that if God be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and made fauourable vnto vs, no good thing can enter into our ſowles. But God beeing intreated and made fauourable vnto vs, our labours are furdered, our doynges doe proſper, and merueilouſely goe forewarde. But then is God intreated, when he ſeeth wee loue to praie, and continually to ſue vnto him, feruently expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all good thynges at his handes, and of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:177584:148"/>
                  <p>Therefore for mine owne parte,<note place="margin">Note vvel</note> when ſo euer I ſee a man that dothe not loue prayer, or delight therein, or that is not as it were poſſeſſed with a vehement deſire and feruent mindefulneſſe thereof: by and by it is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſte token vnto mee, that ſuche a manne poſſeſſeth no greate good gifte of grace in his minde. Againe, when I ſee any man vnſaciably cleauing and fixing him ſelfe to the ſeruice of God, and to accompt it one of his greateſt loſſes, if he doe not continually praie: then doe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably coniecture ſuche a one to be ſtedfaſtly geauen to thinke of all vertue, and to be a very true temple of God.</p>
                  <p>For if a mannes apparraile, if his gate and manners of going, if his gyrning or fond countenance ſhew what a man is (as the wiſe Salomon hath ſaied) muche more is praier, and the ſeruice of God,<note place="margin">

It frameth a mannes life, and ſuffereth not any filthie or abſurde thing to haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the heart. It perſwadeth vs to feare God, and to yelde vnto him the honour whiche we owe vnto him. It teacheth vs to repell all the ſleigtes and deceites of the wicked ſpirit, driuing awaie all vile and vnſeemely thoughtes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it confirmeth a mannes minde in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of all vaine voluptuouſe pleaſure.<note place="margin">A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pride.</note> For this kinde of pride onely becommeth them whiche ſerue and honour Chriſte, to diſdaine in any ſorte to be thrall and bonde to any filthines, and to kepe their mindes free in liberty and vprightneſſe of life. And thus I thinke it is
<pb facs="tcp:177584:149"/> manifeſt to all men, that it is impoſsible for a man ſimply without the helpe of prayer to paſſe his tyme, and to leade out his lyfe in vertue. For howe may it be, that a manne may exerciſe vertue, excepte he doe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaire vnto, and humbly fall downe at the feete of him, who ſupplieth and geueth all vertue vnto menne? Againe howe maye it be, that any man can deſier to be temperat, iuſte, and vertuouſe, excepte he willingly talke and company dayly with him, who requireth at our handes theſe and many other ſuch thinges?</p>
                  <p>Yet thus much in fewe, wil I further open vnto you, that al be it prayer doe finde vs euen ſtuffed with ſinnes, yet doth the ſame lightly purge and make vs cleane ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">Prayer cleanſeth from ſin.</note> What thing then, more high, more excellent, or Diuine, may be applied vnto vs then praier, ſith we finde and plainely knowe the ſame to be a preſente medicine to our ſicke and diſeaſed mindes?<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the Niniuites</note> Firſt therefore let vs conſyder the Niniuites, whome it is manifeſt by the meane of prayer to haue obteined remiſsion of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde ſinnes, and muche wickedneſſe, wherewith they had prouoked againſt them the wrath of God. For ſo ſone as they were entred into the loue and zeale of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſame did ſone drawe them vnto righteouſeneſſe and vertue: preſently amending, and as it were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming that Citie which before exerciſed it ſelfe in all wantonneſſe and lewdneſſe, and which (to be ſhort) lead altogeather a laweleſſe and moſte abhominable life. For prayer being mightier, and of more force then was their long and inueterat cuſtome of ſinne, filled that Citie of theirs, with heauenly lawes, and drew alſo with her into the ſame Citie, temperance, gentleneſſe, mildeneſſe, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177584:149"/> care of the poore. For prayer dothe not indure without theſe vertues to dwell or companie emongeſt vs poore mortall men: but in whoſe heartes ſo euer ſhee chooſeth vnto her ſelfe a ſeate, thoſe dothe ſhee fill with al righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, teaching and excerciſing them to all vertue, and driuing forth al malice and inclination to euill. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man, who before had well knowen that Citie of the Niniuites, had then entred therevnto, truly he would not haue knowen it. So ſuddeinly was the ſame tourned from moſte filthy life to pietie and vertue. For euen as a man ſeeing a beggarly woman whiche was woont to be clothed in vile, and ragged, and filthie clowtes, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decked vppe in garmentes of golde, could not lightly knowe that woman: So if a man had before knowen that Citie, being poore and beggarly, that is to ſaie, voide of al treaſure of vertue and godly behauiour, ſure he would not haue knowen what citie that had ben, ſeeing it then ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and changed by the mightie force of prayer, from lewde and diſſolute, to ſober and vertuouſe.<note place="margin">Marie Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gdalene.</note> But nowe let vs further caſt our eyes to that woman, who hauing ledde her whole life in wantonneſſe and vnchaſtitie, ſo ſone yet as ſhee had throwen her ſelfe downe at Chriſtes feete, obteined health and ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not this onely the vertue of prayer to purge from ſinne,<note place="margin">Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and troubles.</note> but ſhee repelleth alſo and driueth away exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great daungers and imminent perilles. For Dauid that King and wonderfull Prophet, did by the helpe and force of prayer, put to flight many and mighty fierce ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: not trenching or fortifiyng his Hoſt with any other weaponnes or municions, then Prayer: and yet by the meane thereof, deliuered vnto his ſoldiers an vnbloudy
<pb facs="tcp:177584:150"/> victorie. And ſome other Kinges haue vſed to repoſe the hope of their ſafety in the ſkill of their ſoldiars, in the arte of warre, in Archers, in menne of armes, and in light horſemenne, ſo that great King Dauid, in ſteede of a wal and rampier, trenched and backed his Hoſt, with holy and deuout prayers: not making accompte of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Chiefetaines, Marſhalles, Centurions, or other Capitaines, nor gathering maſſes of money, nor proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding armure or weapons, but by prayer obteining and bringing downe from heauen the armour of God. For a heauenly armour in deede is Prayer plentiouſely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foorth before God. And that alone is a ſure holde and a ſafe defence, to them whiche haue with aſſured confidence committed them ſelues to God. For as for the ſtrength and ſkill of menne at armes, experience of Archers, and ſleight in betraiyng the enemie, many times thoſe are deluded and proue to nothing euen by a countenance onely and ſhewe of the contrary battaile, ſtoutneſſe of the enemies, or by many other accidentes and occaſions that fall out. But Prayer is an inuincible armour, and a moſt ſure defence that neuer deceiueth: ouerthrowing as eaſely innumerable thowſands of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it doth one poore ſoldier. For by prayer, not by weapons and armour, did that Dauid of whome we ſpake before (a manne woorthily to be wondered at) ouerthrowe that huge Goliath,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7.</note> when like a terrible diuell he furiouſely ſette vppon him.

                  <p>But nowe that Prayer dothe alſo readily purifie and cleanſe the ſowle being indaungered to ſinne,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.</note> who ſo ſoone as he fell downe at the feete of God, was made cleane. Nowe if God did ſo lightly heale the bodie infected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſickneſſe, muche more readily and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will hee heale the ſowle whiche is diſeaſed. For looke howe muche more pretiouſe is the ſowle then the bodie, ſo muche the more deere is it likely to be vnto God. Innumerable are the examples that might be recited bothe olde and newe, if a man were diſpoſed, to reporte all them that haue ben preſerued and ſaued by the benefitte of prayer.</p>
                  <p>But ſome menne perhappes, of the number of thoſe who being geuen ouer to ſlowth and dulneſſe hath him ſelfe no liſt earneſtly and hartily to praie, will goe about to perſwade, that againſt prayer God ſpake theſe wordes: <hi>Not euery one that ſaith vnto mee Lorde, Lorde, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen,</hi>

                     <hi>but he who doth the will of my Father which is in heauen.</hi> In dede if I beleued onely Prayer to ſuffiſe to our ſaluation, a manne mighte ſeeme
<pb facs="tcp:177584:151"/> not without cauſe, to obiecte that place againſt me. But nowe when I profeſſe Prayer to be the heade and chiefe of all good thinges, the foundation and roote of a fruitful life, there is no cauſe why any man ſhould abuſe thoſe woordes to the excuſe of his ſluggiſhneſſe. For neither can temperance alone, bring ſaluation to a man, if other good thinges be failing, neither care ouer the poore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benignitie, nor any other of thoſe thinges which are vertuouſly done. But it is neceſſary they doe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre togeather in our ſowles: Yet Prayer (I ſaie) as the roote and grownde, is the foundation to them all. For as in a ſhippe or howſe, that whiche is firſt vnderlaied, doth make the ſame ſtrong, and holdeth it togeather, that it fal not a ſunder, ſo doth diligence and continuance in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er holde togeather our life, and make it ſownde, firme, and wel defended on euery ſide: in ſo muche as without that, there can no good fall vnto vs, or owght that may auaile vs to ſaluation.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore we muſt both early forſaking our beddes, preuent with our ſeruing of God the riſing of the ſonne: and euen ſo when we come to our foode, and when wee betake our ſelues to the nightes reſte: nay rather wee ought euery howre to offer vnto God a prayer: that the courſe of our prayer might make euen with the courſe of the daye. But in the winter tyme it becommeth vs alſo to beſtowe the greateſt parte of the night in prayer, and on our knees with muche trembling, to continue inſtantly thereat: thinking our ſelues therein happie, and bleſſed, that wee may beſtowe our tyme in the Seruice of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177584:152"/> they find vnarmed of the defence of prayer. But if they find vs fenſed with prayer, by and by, they be gone: euen as theeues and lewde perſons, when they ſee the ſouldiars ſword ſhaken, and threatened ouer their heads. And if it happen any man to be naked, voyde, and deſtitute of this munition of prayer, ſurely he being pulled out, and as it were torne of, is carried away with diuels, and throwen into many calamities and ſundry miſcheifes. It behooueth vs therefore, that fearing al theſe thinges, thus truly layde before vs, we do continually rampar, and enuironne our ſelues about with Hymnes and Praiers: that God hauing compaſsion of vs may make vs worthy of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, through his only begotten ſonne Ieſu Chriſte, to whom be all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and rule for euer and euer.

After the floodde came wyne, after the flood ye fell to eating all thinges, as commonly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herbes. When perfection was diſpeired of, then was fruition of thoſe thinges graunted. A cleere proufe that wine before the flood was not knowen, appeered in Noe, who was vtterly ignorant, of the vſe of wine. For it was not yet come to the vſe of mans life, nor knowen at all emong menne. When therefore he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſene any other drinke it, nor had tried it him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> he was vnwares hurt thereof. <hi>For Noe planted a vine, and dranke of the frute, and was made drunke.</hi>

                  <p>Not that he was a great drinker, or geuen to be drunke, but bicauſe he was not acquainted with the meaſure, that was to be taken thereof.

There is no entry into faſting by dronckennes, nor to iuſtice by auarice, nor to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce by riot, nor (to conclude in fewe) is there any entrie by vice, vnto vertue.

The ſeruaunt runneth awaie from his maſter that beateth him: yet thou remaineſt ſtyll with wine, whiche dailie beateth thy head. The beſt meaſure of the vſe of wine, is the neceſsitie, and the lacke that the body maie haue thereof. But if thou exceede thoſe boundes, to morow thou wilt come complaining of the heauines of thy head, yaning, gyddy, and ſmelling yet of the vndigeſted wine. Al thing wil ſeeme to moue, al thing to go rownde with thee. For drunkennes as it maketh men ſleepe, as if they were dead, ſo it maketh men to wake, as if they were in a dreame.</p>

For euen as there remaine receiued and retained in the heartes of Chriſtians theſe Commaundementes: <hi>Thou ſhalt woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe thy Lorde God, and ſerue him alone:</hi> And, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> and ſuche other like Preceptes: euen ſo that whiche in thoſe bookes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the ſanctification and healing by faſting, is not made voide, or fruſtrate by any interpretation. For in all tymes, and in all ages of this worlde, faſting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs the ſtronger againſt ſinne. Faſting conquereth concupiſcence, repelleth tentations, abaſeth pride, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth wrath, and all the affections of a good minde and diſpoſition it nurriſheth vppe to ripeneſſe and perfection of all vertue. Eſpecially, if it be alſo ioyned with the beneuolence and pietie of charitie, and doe prouidently exerciſe it ſelfe in woorkes of mercie. For faſting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out almes, is not ſo much a purging of the ſowle, as it is an affliction of the fleſhe. And it is rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be donne for couetouſeneſſe, then for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, when a manne dothe ſo abſteine from meate, that he alſo abſteineth from pietie and good woorkes. Let therefore our faſt (deerely beloued) abownde with fruites of liberalitie, and lette them be plentifull to the poore of Chriſte, with charitable giftes, and louing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.</p>
                  <p>And lette not the meane and inferioure ſorte be ſtayed from this woorke, bicauſe it is little that they can
<pb facs="tcp:177584:165"/> take out of their ſmall ſubſtance and abilitie. Our Lorde knoweth euery man his abilitie, and being a iuſt looker on, ſeeth wel out of what meaſure and portion eche man geaueth. For ſubſtances that be in equalitie vnlike, can not geue like almes. But many times is it made equall in merite, whiche is vnequall in charge. For the minde may be like, where the rente and ſtore is vnlike. To the ende therefore, that theſe thinges may by the helpe of God be regarded with pietie and deuotion, let vs faſt the fourth and the ſixth daie of this weeke.<note place="margin">Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, and Satterday the ymber dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a xj. hundred yeres agoe</note> But on the Satterdaie let vs celebrate Vigil and watching at S.

                  <p>But yet what a prouidence is that, howe great a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of Chriſte, that by healthfull meane, it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene to our hand and prouided, howe man once redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med may the more fully be preſerued? For when our Lorde comming,<note place="margin">Chriſte a redemer and a lavv maker.</note> had healed the woundes which Adam had borne, and cured the olde poiſons of the ſerpent, he gaue a law to man being healed, and charged him to ſinne no more, leſt by ſinning of newe, worſe might fal to him thereof. Then were we narrowly beſet, and brought into a

                  <p>The holly Ghoſt ſpeaketh in the Scriptures, and ſaieth: <hi>By almoſe deedes and faithe, ſinnes are purged.</hi>

A beutifull and heauenly thing (deerly beloued bretherne) is well doing:<note place="margin">The frutes of good vvorkes.</note> a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſuche as beleeue: a ſtrong ſauegarde of a quiet conſcience, a fortification of hope, a defence and ſhilde of faith, and a remedy againſt ſinne. It is a thing ſette in the power of him that dooth it. It is a great thing, and yet eaſie. A Crowne of peace without perill of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is the true gifte, yea the greateſt gifte of God, neceſſarie to the weake, and glorious to the ſtrong. With this a Chriſtian being furniſhed, he ſheweth foorth ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace, he deſerueth well of Chriſte the Iudge, and he maketh God his debter.</p>
                  <p>To this price of healthfull woorkes lette vs willingly, and cheerfully contende. Lette vs all runne in the courſe and race of iuſtice: God and Chriſte looking on: And lette vs that haue now begonne to get aboue the worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:177584:182"/> and theſe tranſitory thinges, not ſtaie now our courſe by any couetouſnes, or lyking of them, or of the worlde. If the daie either of our departing, or of perſecution ſhall finde vs light, and free without burthen, running in this race of good woorkes, our Lorde will neuer faile to rewarde our merites. He will geeue to ſuche as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for their woorkes in peace a white and pure Crowne: and to ſuche as gette the victory in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he wil geeue a dubble Crowne of purple colour for their paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſuffering. Amen.</p>
